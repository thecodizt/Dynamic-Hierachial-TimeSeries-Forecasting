# Dynamic Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting

This project focuses on hierarchical time series forecasting with a unique twist - the ability to dynamically generate hierarchies. We leverage language model assisted embeddings to create clusters at various levels, converting cross-sectional information into any required number of levels dynamically.

## Features

- **Dynamic Hierarchies**: Our approach allows for the creation of dynamic hierarchies, providing flexibility in how data is aggregated and analyzed.

- **Contextual Embeddings**: We use advanced language model assisted embeddings to capture contextual information, which aids in the creation of meaningful clusters.

- **Hierarchical Forecasting**: Our method preserves the relationships within the hierarchy, allowing for nuanced and dynamic forecasting models.
